# RYYD - A Mock Taxi Hailing Service
This exercise aims to illustrate the fundamentals of building a front-end in React. In this exercise, I designed an SPA dashboard and master-detail page using React. The React app was set up to consume data from an API service provided by the included server. React Router was used for navigating between pages. React hooks were used with functional components in place of class based components for stateful components. UI-kit was used for providing user interface CSS-based components that were manually converted to React.
